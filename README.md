# Who is Kimgh06?
I am an engineer who wants to learn all kinds of knowledge and technology.
I graduated "Gwangju Software Meister High School" in South Korea and learned about Computer Sciences and Engineering in there before.
I like to do projects alone or with others for useful and funny.

- Make web server using node.js.
- Write codes for System Engineering using Python, JS, and any other programming languages.
- Learn about Mathematics to think how it could be applied to my life.
